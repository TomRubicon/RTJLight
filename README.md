# Run The Jewels audio reactive LED sculpture
## General Info
3d printed RTJ sculpture in the style of the album art for RTJ4. It runs on an ESP32 dev board which controls a dense ws2812b strip of leds. It has multiple lighting patterns which can be selected via a button built into the side. If the button is held down, the ESP32 enters AP mode and the user can enter their wifi credentials. Once the sculpture is connected to wifi it can receive audio data from a computer on the network running a seperate python script, the leds will then react to that audio data.

## Construction
Shortly after RTJ4 was released they ran a contest (https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/21/21395745/run-the-jewels-3d-model-logo-pistol-fist-remix-contest) where a 3d model for the logo was made available. I brought that model into Fusion360 and built the enclosure around it. The hands were post processed with filler primer and sanded down to get the nice smooth polygonal look. The STL files I used are available in this repo.
